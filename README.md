# DEV BRANCH

# RMMUD
What is RMMUD? RMMUD stands for RandomGgames' Minecraft Mod Updater and Downloader. This is a script which automatically downloads latest versions of mods and copies them into as many mods folders as you set up with just one click (after configuration that is)! I specifically made this because I have many minecraft instances spanning different versions as well as having a few server folders, all with different mod sets. Some similar, some not. I've made this script so I can update the mods in all of them all at once!
